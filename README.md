### Project Overview
Project Overview:

This project demonstrates my journey in data analysis, showcasing key skills gained in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Using Microsoft Excel, SQL, and Power BI, I tackled various tasks, from managing data and performing statistical analysis to building reports and visualizations. At The Incubator Hub, I strengthened my skills in SQL for data querying and database management, as well as Power BI for advanced data transformations and dashboards. My GitHub portfolio highlights these competencies, reflecting a solid foundation in data analysis and a commitment to continuous learning and skill development.


### Objectives
- Develop Data Cleaning and Management Skills
- Enhance Data Analysis Proficiency
- Master SQL for Data Querying
- Create Visualizations for Insights
- Build a Professional Portfolio
- Strengthen Data Transformation Techniques
- Foster a Continuous Learning Mindset

### Key Features
- Data Cleaning Processes:
- Data Analysis Functions in Excel
- SQL Database Creation and Management
- Interactive Dashboards in Power BI
- Data Transformation with Power Query
- Portfolio Documentation on GitHub
- Subscription Analysis and Regional Sales Insights
- Reports and Charts for Data Presentation

### Outcome
The project aims to build a comprehensive skill set in data analysis, preparing for a successful role in data analytics.

### Tools Used in Learning
#### 1. Microsoft Excel
- For Data Cleaning
- For Analysis
- For Visualization

  
#### 2. SQL (Structured Query Language)
- For Querying Data


#### 3. GitHub
- For Portfolio Building


#### 4. Power BI

- My Experiences

During my studies at The Incubator Hub, I developed skills in working with complex data, identifying patterns, and extracting insights. Key experiences include:

### Microsoft Excel Class
- Data Management
- Mastered data entry fundamentals
- Conducted statistical analysis using Excel functions

Here are some formulas for text cleaning:

- =PROPER(TRIM(B6)) â€” Used to enter each word in a name while removing extra spaces.

  ![Properly Entered and Trimmed Name](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd81ab26-7f56-4aad-bd0f-58f31e8f9c57)

  
- =FIND(" ", B6) â€” Used to find the position of a space in a name with separated words.

![Space](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a48b189-aab0-48d5-8568-35ad176e8b77)

  
- =LEFT(B6, FIND(" ", B6)) â€” Extracts the first name (left side of the space) into a separate column.

  ![First Name Separated](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/909dd661-4eaf-41ab-9778-80b98bc44701)


- =RIGHT(B6, LEN(B6) - FIND(" ", B6)) â€” Extracts the last name (right side of the space) into a separate column.

  ![Second Name Separated](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f36f9e8c-4b09-4619-a2fa-537a99e00065)


  - =B6 & " " & C6 â€” Used to join the first name and last name into one cell with a space in between.
    ![Full Name](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/709cefed-c1d9-434b-b36a-059434797e14)

    



Built reports with pivot tables and created charts for visual representation


### SQL Class

Created databases and tables
Used SQL functions in calculations
Applied SQL clauses and operations for data manipulation

### GitHub

We were taught how to use GitHub to build portfolios. Below are some of the key markdown elements we learned:

Tags (#) are used to create headings of different sizes.

Pressing "Enter" creates a new line or paragraph.

Dashes (-) are used to create bullet points.

Square brackets ([]) and parentheses (())** are used to create hyperlinks for file downloads. Add the file link in parentheses. e.g [Project](#project)

Image Uploads can be done by linking to image files in your folder.

Triple dashes (---) create a horizontal line or underline.

Backticks (`) are used to write code, including SQL, inline or in blocks.

Colon syntax (: emoji:) displays emojis, such as ðŸ˜†.

Pipes (|) are used to create tables.

Example Table Structure:

``` |Heading 1|Heading 2|Heading 3|
 |---------|---------|---------|
 |Table 1|Table 2|Table 3|
```



  
### Power BI

Learned Power BI fundamentals
Used Power Query for data transformation
These experiences have equipped me with valuable skills for a role as a data analyst. I continuously seek opportunities to expand my knowledge, exploring new data analysis tools and techniques in my free time. Driven by a passion for uncovering insights and solving problems, I thrive in both collaborative and independent work environments.
